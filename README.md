This folder contains analysis scripts used in the paper Rule-based and stimulus-based cues bias auditory decisions via different computational and physiological mechanisms by Nathan Tardiff, Lalitta Suriya-Arunroj, Yale E. Cohen, and Joshua I. Gold.

The data is available at: https://osf.io/f9nyr/. 

The analysis code (analysis and FitGDDM) is avalable at at: https://github.com/TheGoldLab/Analysis_Tardiff_etal_AuditoryPriors.

Paths may need to be changed and processed data/model outputs generated in order to run scripts. 

The matlab_dependencies folder should be added to the path for all matlab scripts.

In addition to the supporting files included, analysis scripts/model fitting rely on the following outside dependences:
